## Overview
```
TITAN II is an exploitation tool, C2, and Red Teaming tool that I have created in order to allow myself
more mobillity and less critical thinking. Automating the hard things like DC Sync's Kerberoasts etc.
```

## Features

Home

```
The Home panel creates an easy to read layout of the attack
platform including hosts discovered, exploited, uptime, etc.
```
Network

```
The Network Panel is a network scanner that allows for the silent or aggressive
scanning of a network taking the commands out of the mix allowing for a quick and easy scan.
```

Hosts

```
The Hosts tab allows you to import discovered hosts from the Network panel and attack them,
creating an easy to understand at a glance work space without sparing any important information.
Quick click button shortcuts to utilize post exploitation modules.
```

Exploits

```
The Exploits panel is where all the exploits are stored,
TITAN II is created in a way that allows for easy POC
importation and importation of pre-existing Metasploit Ruby Modules
```

Payloads

```
The Payloads panel allows the quick and easy creation adn deployment of
payloads on the C2 allowing for persistence, hashdumping, and a numerous
amount of other eye catching C2 features. Macro injection, AV evasion, and more.

bare-metal host that is running the TITAN II C2 server.

at one time and keeping communications centralized in one tool. A one stop shop for
any good Red Team engagement. Inlcuding sharing scan files, exploited machiones, etc. Uses PGP.
